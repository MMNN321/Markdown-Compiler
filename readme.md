# Markdown Compiler

This is a UI application for a subprocess that compiles markdown files to specific pdf files.
This is open source but I don't know if the subprocess will be open source too.

I made this program to create work sheets or learning sheets. It should help users
to create fast and easy printable sheets. With the different designs it is also
possible to personalize the work. If this program gets ready, I'll provide more
information to my status if I will contribute the main process or not.
